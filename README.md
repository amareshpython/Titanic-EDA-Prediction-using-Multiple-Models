# Titanic-EDA-Prediction-using-Multiple-Models
Titanic Survival Historical Data based prediction on Survival

This is the legendary Titanic ML competition â€“ the best, first challenge for you to dive into ML competitions and familiarize yourself with how the Kaggle platform works.

The competition is simple: use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

In this project we used following classification methods to predict Survival

     models	              test_score
4	  Decision Tree	      81.71
2	  Random Forest	      81.40
6	  KNeighbors	        80.07
3	  Logistic Regression	80.02
5	  SVM	                78.68
8	  Perceptron	        78.68
1	  SGDClassifier	      78.45
7	  GaussianNB	        76.43
